Overview of the Project

Simple Blog Application
Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Simple Blog Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This application enables users to create, edit, delete, and view blogs. The aim is to showcase full-stack development skills and provide a seamless user experience for blogging.

Key Activities
Backend Development (Node.js & Express.js):

Set up a RESTful API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing blogs.
Integrate MongoDB for storing blog-related data such as title, content, author, and timestamps.
Implement user authentication and authorization for secure blog management.
Frontend Development (React.js):

Develop a responsive and user-friendly interface using React.js.
Build components for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting blog posts.
Use React Router for navigation between pages like the blog list, single blog view, and blog editor.
Database Integration (MongoDB):

Design a schema to store blog details, including fields for the blog title, content, author, and published date.
Ensure efficient data handling and retrieval using MongoDB queries.
Additional Features:

Add pagination or infinite scroll for the blog list page.
Include a search bar for finding blogs by title or keywords.
Provide a feature to display blog statistics, such as the total number of blogs and authors.
Deployment:

Host the backend on Render or Heroku.
Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.
Connect the backend and frontend for a fully functional application.
